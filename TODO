    WHICH PUBLIC DBs ????
 - The length of the GEDCOM TAG is a maximum of 31 characters, with the first 15 characters being unique.
 - The total length of a GEDCOM line, including leading white space, level number, cross-reference number, tag, value, delimiters, and terminator, must not exceed 255 (wide) characters.
 - Leading white space (tabs, spaces, and extra line terminators) preceding a GEDCOM line should be ignored by the reading system. Systems generating GEDCOM should not place any white space in front of the GEDCOM line.
